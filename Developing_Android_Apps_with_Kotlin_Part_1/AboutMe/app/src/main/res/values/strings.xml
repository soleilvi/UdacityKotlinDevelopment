    <string name ="bio">Impossible Creatures is a 3D RTS game that pits the player against an evil villain.
        Using Earth\â€™s most formidable animals as building blocks,
        the player must create an army of genetically-altered mutant monsters in a titanic struggle
        to protect an unsuspecting world.
    \n\n\nImpossible Creatures is a steampunk real-time strategy game released in 2003 and
        developed by Relic Entertainment in conjunction with Microsoft Studios.
        Its unique feature is that the armies used are all created by the player.
        Inspired by the works of H. G. Wells, the armies consist of 9 creatures;
        each one is a combination of any two animals from a list of 76 (51 with no downloads).
        Many animals possess inherent abilities to add more strategic depth to the game.
        There is an extensive single-player campaign as well as online multiplayer functionality
        with different game modes, add-ons, custom maps, mods, and scenarios.
